The neural net model can be used for classification problems: the neural net classifies a large amount of incoming data into a finite number of possible classes. 

When outcomes consist of only two classes (yes/no, sick/healthy, 0/1) these neural net models produce probabilities for each outcome, and typically a probability of 0.5 or greater predicts an outcome of 1, and less than 0.5 predicts an outcome of 0. 

When more three or more classes are to be predicted, this neural net model uses One Vs. All classification.
